<h3>Foreword </h3>

<blockquote>
<p> <em>This White Paper is intended for developers of cross-platform web
    applications (loosely defined as software applications that computer
    applications that use the World Wide Web in significant ways, including as
    a data source or as a user interface, and that may be deployed in multiple
    software environments).  The <a href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a>
    provides a framework in which such applications can easily be developed.
    More information on the PIA approach to customizable web applications can
    be found in <a href="wp-webapp.html"> Web Applications and the PIA</a>.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> <em>[will be sent in as a proposal to <a
    href="http://www9.org/w9-call-developer-extend.html">WWW9</a> Developer's
    Day XML track.]</em> 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Major trends in web applications (computer applications that use the
      World Wide Web in significant ways, including as a data source or as a
      user interface) include: a proliferation of server platforms, clients,
      and development environments, increasing use of dynamic content,
      increasing use of XML, and increasing use of collaboration and
      customization as part both of the development process and of deployed
      applications.  One of the major consequences of these trends is an
      increasing need for <em>cross-platform</em> applications and development
      environments.
  </p>

  <p> The <a href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a> is an XML-based web
      application framework that is well-suited as a basis for developing and
      deploying cross-platform applications.  Some of the PIA's
      characteristics that support this include the PIA's reliance on XML as a
      single meta-syntax for both documents and processing, the use of
      standard API's (including SAX and DOM) for easy inclusion in existing
      XML applications, a small, portable core document-processing ``engine'',
      and an open-source reference implementation.
  </p>

  <p> The PIA can be seen as either an alternative or an adjunct to existing
      web application platforms, including those based on the XSLT
      transformation language, Java Server Pages, and Java Servlets.  The
      document-processing engine implements a complete programming language
      with XML syntax; it can be used <em>either</em> in a style-sheet-like
      mode with separate data and styles, or embedded in active documents.
      This allows it to fit easily into many different server platforms. 
  </p>

  <p> The PIA technology enables platform-independence in several ways.  It
      has a reference implementation in Java, which runs on any computing
      platform with a JVM.  The processing engine is simple, and easily ported
      to a wide range of different platforms.  And applications, which are
      written in XML, can be moved between platforms with no need for
      rewriting. 
  </p>

<h2>Trends in Web Applications and Development Environments</h2>

<blockquote>
<p> <em>In this paper we briefly mention those major trends in web
    applications that strongly imply a need for cross-platform applications
    and application development.  A more complete discussion can be found in a
    companion White Paper, <a href="wp-trends.html">Trends in Web
    Applications</a>.  </em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Proliferation of Platforms</h3>

<p> The first major trend we will examine is the proliferation of platforms
    for deployment (servers), use (clients), and development of web
    applications.
</p>

<h4>Servers</h4>

<p> The number of server platforms on which one might consider running a web
    application is continuing to increase, as it has ever since the Web was
    created.  Although the <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft
    Web Server Survey</a> shows that one web server, <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, has slightly over 50% of the
    market,  it still shows nine other servers used at over 60,000 sites
    each.  
</p>

<table align="center">
  <tr><th>Market Share for Top Servers Across All Domains</th></tr>
  <tr><td align="center">
         <img src="http://www.netcraft.com/Survey/Reports/199912/overallc.gif"
         alt="">

  </tr>
  <tr><td align="right"><font size="-1">Source: <a
	href="http://www.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a> Web Server Survey, <a
	href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/"
	>http://www.netcraft.com/survey/</a>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p> In addition, this survey is somewhat misleading in two different ways.
    First, it groups servers together by vendor (so that the ``Microsoft''
    category, at nearly 25%, covers a total of five different server
    versions).  Second, it covers only publicly-accessible web sites.  The
    second is the more important effect:  the majority of web applications at
    the moment are <em>intranet</em> sites, hidden behind corporate firewalls.
</p>

<p> Moreover, ``traditional'' web servers are unlikely to dominate the field
    of web <em>applications</em> in the future, and indeed may not dominate
    even today.  Small web servers can now be found inside of a wide range of
    ``appliances'' including printers, scanners, routers, ethernet switches,
    and file servers.  Still others are specialized servers running on
    ordinary personal computers in order to ``web enable'' some attached
    peripheral such as a scanner or digital camera (``web-cam'').
</p>

<h4>Clients</h4>

<p> The web client field has not been dominated by a single browser since
    Microsoft started grabbing a significant market share away from Netscape.
    But even though these two currently make up most of the browser market,
    there are such significant differences between versions that the effective
    number of clients is increasing, not decreasing.  This trend is likely to
    continue, because new browsers like Opera continue to appear, and old
    standbys continue to be popular in niche markets (for example, visually
    handicapped users overwhelmingly prefer the text-based Lynx browser).
</p>

<p> Furthermore, as with servers, web browsers on personal computers represent
    a declining segment of a potentially huge market for web clients.  It is
    now possible to browse the web from a WebTV, a Palm Pilot or other PDA, an
    alphanumeric pager, or a cellular phone.  Web-enabled microwave ovens,
    refrigerators, and even dishwashers have been announced; such appliances
    are likely to include a web <em>server</em> as well, with the client doing
    double duty as web browser and front panel.
</p>


<h4>Proxies</h4>

<p> An additional segment of the web application field that has gotten little
    attention so far is the proxy: an application that sits <em>between</em>
    client and server, performing some useful function.  Web caches, banner-ad
    eliminators, and ``parental choice'' filters all fall into this category;
    a huge number of users have used this kind of web application without
    knowing it (especially since AOL runs a proxy for all of its customers).
</p>

<p> In the future, we are likely to see an increase in the number of web
    applications that operate as proxies for performing a variety of
    <em>document processing</em> operations, including formatting, annotation,
    and content filtering.
</p>


<h4>Development Environments</h4>

<p> Unlike the platform arena, there has never been a single strong market
    leader in development environments for web applications.  Indeed, most
    applications are probably developed using a combination of text editors
    for code, and word processors for HTML documents.  A large amount of
    content, moreover, is <em>imported</em> from other environments, including
    databases and text files (for example, newswires, mailing lists, and
    Usenet news feeds).
</p>

<p> When we leave the <em>original</em> development environment and look at
    customization, however, the field is narrowed somewhat.  Probably most
    free text input on the web is done using HTML forms (for example, news
    items and comments submitted to <a
    href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>).  Many sites include personal
    web pages, most of which are probably created using a browser. 
</p>

<p> With the advent of the WebDAV protocol, which allows ``distributed
    authoring'' by giving HTTP clients access to server-based files and
    metadata, it is likely that web applications with multiple developers will
    be developed using multiple tools, since each developer will be able to
    use their own favorite set.  Even without WebDAV, many applications
    (especially in the Open Source community) are developed using CVS and
    other server-based version-control systems. 
</p>

<p> Indeed, the line between dynamic content and the development environment
    is already getting rather fuzzy.  It is ``traditional'' to upload dynamic
    content to a server, and have it converted into HTML (possibly in several
    different styles) ``on the fly'' as it's being streamed out to the client.
    Bug content developers have access to the same stylesheet-based
    transformation tools at their desktops, so they could perform the style
    transformations once and upload the resulting <em>static</em> content,
    which would place less of a load on the server.  Then again, a
    sufficiently clever server could accomplish the same thing by caching.
</p>


<h2>The need for Cross-Platform Applications</h2>

<p> One common thread among all of these trends is that the total market for
    web application platforms and development environments is growing far
    faster than the market share of any one participant.  ``Traditional''
    platforms in these areas, such as Unix servers, personal computers, and
    word-processing applications are being marginalized by less visible but
    more numerous embedded applications.  Even among the traditional platforms
    no single vendor controls the market, although one could make a good case
    for open-source platforms predominating in all areas the near future (as
    they already do in servers).
</p>

<p> Another point to consider is that most web applications evolve over time,
    and may involve many developers, content contributors, customizers, and
    collaborators.  Not only will these contributors all be using different
    development platforms, but the application may have to be ported from its
    original <em>server</em> platform to another.  This may happen because of
    inadequate performance, software or hardware obsolescence, or external
    factors such as corporate mergers or standardization decisions.
</p>

<p> Web applications have moved away from the simple world of static documents
    being passed from server to browser, toward more dynamic systems in which
    operations are performed on documents in all components of the system.
    Increasingly these dynamic systems are using XML as a <em>lingua
    franca</em>, representing tranditional documents, data, configuration
    files, and style transformations using a single easily-processed syntax.
</p>

<p> Clearly, wise web developers will want to keep their options open, which
    means using technologies that are as platform-neutral as possible.
    Fortunately, the increasing use of XML provides the means.  Because XML
    is, itself, completely platform-neutral, any application that can be
    specified entirely in XML will be platform-neutral as well.
</p>

<p> Another reason for platform-neutrality is that a single application may
    need to be deployed on multiple platforms from the beginning.  A web
    application is not necessarily a public web site -- most are intranet
    servers, and an increasing number are merely programs that run on desktop
    computers.  Anyone developing one of these applications may well want to
    sell it to more than one customer, and even to customers running a wide
    range of operating systems and servers.
</p>

<p> The argument for platform neutrality also applies -- rather strongly -- to
    consultants who develop web sites and web applications under contract.
    There is, of course, no way to control what the customer's platform of
    choice will be: the only options are to be platform neutral or to
    artificially restrict one's potential clientele.

<h2>The PIA Web Application Framework</h2>

<h3>PIA-based Web Applications</h3>


<p> The PIA is primarily designed for web applications that are
    ``document-oriented'' -- both the ``content'' or data, and the processing
    instructions (including so-called ``business rules'' as well as
    stylesheets and ``macros'') are represented as XML documents.  The PIA is
    also server-based: all of its processing is done on the application's
    server.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> We note in passing that the fact that the PIA does its document
      processing on the server in no way prevents active documents, including
      Cascading Style Sheets, Javascript and Java applets, from being passed
      to a browser client where appropriate.  It <em>does</em> mean that
      ``stylesheet'' processing </em>can<em> be done entirely on the server,
      making an application accessible from <em>any</em> browser.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The point is worth emphasizing: a PIA web application consists
    <em>entirely</em> of XML and HTML documents, except for the
    document-processing ``engine'' that interprets the processing
    instructions.  Using server-side XML to build a web application has a
    number of advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> XML is a widely-accepted standard.  XML files are easily ported between
       platforms and shared among applications.
  </li>
  <li> Because processing takes place on the server side, all the browser
       needs to see is ordinary HTML (customized, if necessary, for the
       particular client).
  </li>
  <li> Because XML files are simply documents with a standardized format, the
       same file can be processed in several different ways.  This can be
       used to make a site index or a ``what's new'' list, or to improve
       interoperability with other sites (for example, many news sites
       maintain an XML file with the day's headlines, for the benefit of
       portal sites).
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>A Platform-Independent Web Application Framework</h3>

<p> The PIA's particular XML processing engine has a few additional
    advantages: 
</p>

<ol>
  <li> It provides a complete set of processing operations, represented as XML
       ``tags,'' rather than providing a limited set (e.g. the
       tree-transformation operations of XSLT) or relying on ``escapes'' into
       another language (as do JSP, PHP, and others).  This means that PIA
       applications can be developed using any XML-aware development
       environment. 
  </li>
  <li> The mapping from tags to processing operations is completely defined by
       a document, called a ``tagset,'' that is completely separate from the
       document being processed.  Limiting the operations available when
       processing a document gives a simple but very effective form of
       security that can be especially useful in applications that allow users
       to upload or create documents.
  </li>
  <li> Unlike some other systems that are <em>purely</em> XML, the PIA is
       capable of processing ordinary HTML documents, optionally with a few
       XML tags embedded in them as extensions.  This makes it easier to
       incorporate ``legacy'' HTML documents into a primarily XML-based
       application.  HTML documents are also easier for users to create using
       simple text editors, which makes PIA-based applications easier to
       customize in a world that is not yet entirely ``XML-ready.''
  </li>
  <li> Because the processing engine itself is simple, and the set of
       basic processing operations is small, the PIA's document processing
       engine is easily ported to various server platforms.
  </li>
  <li> The reference implementation is written in Java, which is itself
       platform-neutral. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>The PIA and Other Platforms</h3>

<blockquote><em>
  A detailed discussion of the relationship between the PIA and other web
  technologies, including standards and protocols, can be found in
  <a href="wp-webapp.html#15">Web Applications and the PIA</a>.  In this
  section, we discuss making the PIA interoperate with other application
  platforms.

Integrating the PIA into other web application platforms

	In most cases either the DPS, the site package, or both can be
	incorporated into an application, as required.

	<em>[for each platform, what's required.  Identify easy targets]</em>

  Java-based systems

    Servlet engines

	This is one of the easiest.  There are two servlet classes provided;
	one is just the document processor, the other includes the site
	package.  <em>[give sample code]</em>

    Cocoon

	Equally easy: Processor class.  <em>[less clear how to integrate the
	site package with Cocoon's processing model]</em>

    SAX-based systems

	SAX is an API that interfaces between an application and a parser; the
	PIA can operate on either side of the interface. 

    DOM-based systems

	The PIA can read and write DOM trees.  The site package can provide
	a complete site map or any subtree of it in the form of a DOM tree. 

  C-based systems

    Apache

    Expat-based systems
