<h3>Foreword </h3>

<blockquote>
<p> <em>This White Paper is intended for web developers.  It describes a way
    of creating platform independent applications that can not only be
    deployed on many different operating systems and servers, but also
    interoperate with existing and future web applications.  The <a
    href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a> framework provides support for the
    development of platform independent applications and is further described
    in a companion white paper, <a
    href="wp-webapp.html"> "Web Applications and the PIA"</a>.  </em></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> <em>[For submission to <a
    href="http://www9.org/w9-call-developer-extend.html">WWW9</a> Developer's
    Day XML track.]</em> 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Developers face a maddeningly wide array of choices for creating web
  applications.  In addition to choosing an operating system and web server
  for deployment, most applications require choosing a database, development
  environment, scripting language(s), HTML standard, and whether to use
  Javascript or other client side components.  These choices have direct and,
  sometimes unintended, consequences for the long-term success of the
  application.  For example, a Javascript dependent site for stock trading
  might look great on Internet Explorer 5.0, but may be entirely inaccessible
  to the growing number of customers who have wireless Web access from a PDA.
  Even worse, compatibility issues may cause months of reengineering and cost
  a company their most precious commodity in this web world -- lead time.  As
  an example, Active Server Pages may make it easier to maintain an online
  catalog using a tool like Front Page, but may not run on the same
  operating system as the C based CGI scripts for tracking shopping carts and
  transactions.
  </p>
  <p> Despite the growing popularity of Apache, PHP, and other open source
      tools that operate on multiple platforms, the choices for web
      application design, development, and deployment continue to proliferate
      and diverge.  [do we need examples here?]  This paper describes an
      approach to Web application development that minimizes platform
      dependencies and maximizes interoperability.  A somewhat unconventional
      use of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) plays a key role in this design.
      Applications consist primarily "active" XML pages which use a vocabulary
      of domain-specific markup language tags.  The server interprets these
      tags to perform processing appropriate to the context, for example to
      insert the results of a database query or simplify the content
      for a text only client. 
  </p>

  <p> The wide support for XML ensures that these types of applications can be
      developed and modified on virtually any existing platform.  To handle
      the remaining platform dependent issues, namely tag implementation and
      application configuration, we propose using technology based on the open
      source <a href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a> (Platform for
      Information Applications).  The PIA is a Java based web server and
      application framework in which tag actions can be implemented in Java
      and site configuration information is flexibly specified via XML
      documents.  The PIA provides a number of features which make it
      well-suited to prototyping and customizing web applications.
  </p>
  <p> These sort of XML based web applications can be deployed on existing Web
      servers either by incorporating the PIA engine as a module
      (e.g. servlet), or by creating static versions of the pages with the
      appropriate substitutions.  As server engines provide more sophisticated
      native support for XML processing, these application should enjoy true
      platform independence.

<h2>The Proliferation of Web Applications and Development Environments</h2>

<blockquote>
<p> <em>As a developer, should I use Apache or IIS?  Should I write scripts in
PERL, PHP, ASP, JSP, or some other language?  Should I include Javascript in
my HTML or HTML in my Java?  Answering these questions gets harder every day
as the number of servers, clients, languages, development environments, and
target markets continue to grow and change.  Open source software and platform
independent designs can avoid many of these difficulties, speed development,
and reduce maintenance costs. </em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Proliferation of Servers, operating systems, and languages</h3>

<blockquote>
<p> <img align="right" src="Images/platform-cube.png" />
    Servers, operating systems, and languages constitute a three-dimensional
    space; any point in that space represents a ``platform'' upon which a web
    application can be built.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    According to the <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft Web Server
    Survey</a> there are 10 different software "vendors" providing Web servers
    to more than 60,000 public sites each.  If we counted separately the
    number of different (incompatible) versions of server software from the
    same vendor the number of different servers would grow substantially and
    continues to increase.
</p>

<p> The open source Apache software leads the web server market with
    approximately 50% of the publicly accessible web sites.  It does run on
    most operating systems (in particular most Unix and Windows variants) and
    provides a good deal of flexibility and system configuration (at the cost
    of increasing installation and management complexity).  This flexibility
    allows Apache to work with wide range of different languages for providing
    dynamic content.  CGI scripts can be written in C, PERL, Python, or any
    other traditional programming language, while modules support server side
    processing of embedded scripting languages such as PHP or JSP (Java Server
    Pages).  While most servers provide some support for scripting languages,
    they vary greatly in the allowable languages and interfaces especially for
    scripts embedded in HTML/XML pages.

<p> 
</p>

<p> We note in passing that ``traditional'' web servers are unlikely to dominate the field
    of web <em>applications</em> in the future, and indeed may not dominate
    even today.  Small web servers can now be found inside of a wide range of
    ``appliances'' including printers, scanners, routers, ethernet switches,
    and file servers.  Still others are specialized servers running on
    ordinary personal computers in order to ``web enable'' some attached
    peripheral such as a scanner or digital camera (``web-cam'').
</p>

<h4>Clients</h4>
[By market share, IE probably is doing better than ever.  However the rise of
nontraditional clients like cellphones will change that.  Also, the use of
older browsers comprises a significant chunk of the market.]

<p>
The range and capabilities of web clients seems to be growing and diverging even
faster than Web servers.  Looking at just PC-based browsers, one sees great
differences in how they render HTML much less advanced features like
Javascript and style sheets.  Moreover, each new version introduces
significant changes in functionality not supported by the installed base -- effectively increasing the number of clients.  This trend is likely to
    continue, because new browsers like Opera continue to appear, and old
    standbys continue to be popular in niche markets (for example, visually
    handicapped users overwhelmingly prefer the text-based Lynx browser).
</p>

<p> Furthermore, as with servers, web browsers on personal computers represent
    a declining segment of a potentially huge market for web clients.  It is
    now possible to browse the web from a WebTV, a Palm Pilot or other PDA, an
    alphanumeric pager, or a cellular phone.  Web-enabled microwave ovens,
    refrigerators, and even dishwashers have been announced; such appliances
    are likely to include a web <em>server</em> as well, with the client doing
    double duty as web browser and front panel.
</p>

    Trends</a> page at <a href="http://www.upsdell.com/BrowserNews">Browser
    News</a> shows a month-by-month history of browser usage since 1998.
</p>

[implications for developers?]


<h4>Proxies</h4>

<p> An additional segment of the web application field that has gotten little
    attention so far is the proxy: an application that sits <em>between</em>
    client and server, performing some useful function.  Web caches, banner-ad
    eliminators, and ``parental choice'' filters all fall into this category;
    a huge number of users have used this kind of web application without
    knowing it (especially since AOL runs a proxy for all of its customers).
</p>

<p> In the future, we are likely to see an increase in the number of web
    applications that operate as proxies for performing a variety of
    <em>document processing</em> operations, including formatting, annotation,
    and content filtering.
</p>


<h4>Development Environments</h4>
[split into the application development and content development.  note
uniqueness of Web applications in that non-programmers help evolve them over
time]

<p> Unlike the platform arena, there has never been a single strong market
    leader in development environments for web applications.  Indeed, most
    applications are probably developed using a combination of text editors
    for code, and word processors for HTML documents.  A large amount of
    content, moreover, is <em>imported</em> from other environments, including
    databases and text files (for example, newswires, mailing lists, and
    Usenet news feeds).
</p>

[Don't we want to distinguish between "discussion group" and application customization?]
<p> When we leave the <em>original</em> development environment and look at
    customization, however, the field is narrowed somewhat.  Probably most
    free text input on the web is done using HTML forms (for example, news
    items and comments submitted to <a
    href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>).  Many sites include personal
    web pages, most of which are probably created using a browser. 
</p>

<p> With the advent of the WebDAV protocol, which allows ``distributed
    authoring'' by giving HTTP clients access to server-based files and
    metadata, it is likely that web applications with multiple developers will
    be developed using multiple tools, since each developer will be able to
    use their own favorite set.  Even without WebDAV, many applications
    (especially in the Open Source community) are developed using CVS and
    other server-based version-control systems. 
</p>

<p> Indeed, the line between dynamic content and the development environment
    is already getting rather fuzzy.  It is ``traditional'' to upload dynamic
    content to a server, and have it converted into HTML (possibly in several
    different styles) ``on the fly'' as it's being streamed out to the client.
    But content developers have access to the same stylesheet-based
    transformation tools at their desktops, so they could perform the style
    transformations once and upload the resulting <em>static</em> content,
    which would place less of a load on the server.  Then again, a
    sufficiently clever server could accomplish the same thing by caching.
</p>

<p> Another point to consider is that most web applications evolve over time,
    and may involve many developers, content contributors, customizers, and
    collaborators.  Not only will these contributors all be using different
    development platforms, but the application may have to be ported from its
    original <em>server</em> platform to another.  This may happen because of
    inadequate performance, software or hardware obsolescence, or external
    factors such as corporate mergers or standardization decisions.
</p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Applications</h2>


<p> Developers have recognized the need to maintain compatibility between web
    applications.  Integrating the process of ordering an item from a
    retailer's site with the fulfillment of that order through the supplier's
    site provides enormous productivity and efficiency gains.  This is one of
    the motivating factors in the widespread adoption of XML as a platform
    independent <em>lingua franca</em> for representing documents and data.
</p>

<p> XML is a step in the right direction, but it does not, by itself, lead to
    platform independent web applications.  Developers must still choose what
    server, language, operating system, a database, etc. on which to implement
    their processing.  Given the wide array of options outlines above, this
    can be a difficult task.  It becomes impossible when one starts to
    consider:
    <ul>
    <li> applications which will be  deployed on multiple sites (e.g. local,
    customizable 
    intranet applications which run in many different web server contexts)
    <li> maintenance, who is responsible for updating the content and
    processing
    <li>integration, putting several existing functions together into one application
    </ul>
</p>

<p> By adding a standard design and processing model, we can leverage XML
    to achieve the goal of platform independent web applications.  In
    particular, applications consists of XML documents developed using a set
    of application-specific tags.  In a typical scenario, a client request is
    directed towards one XML document which the server retrieves and
    processes by dynamically modifying the XML according to the context and
    configuration information.  
</p>
<p> An entire application consists simply of XML documents and some
    specification of the processing associated with the tags.   This
    specification is itself an XML document, which we call a <i>tagset</i>.
    Most tags will be defined in terms of other tags, but for some of the
    "primitive" tags, the tagset references a native implementation.  In our
    case, this would be a Java class implementing the appropriate interface.  
</p>

[The following section would be a good sidebar]
<h3>Web Applications: an Overview</h3>

<p> In essence, a web application is a web site or part of a web site that
    performs some useful function (for example, configuring a printer or
    ordering groceries).  It typically consists of the following components:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> A <strong>Web Server:</strong> the ``platform'' on which the
       application runs.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Documents:</strong> a mixture of ``static'' documents, which
       are served to the client browser essentially unchanged, and ``active''
       documents, which are processed on the server and which may perform
       ``actions'' ranging from simply updating a counter to complex database
       transactions. 
  </li>
  <li> A <strong>Document Processing Engine</strong> that processes the active
       documents.  This is often part of the server, although in the common
       case of ``CGI scripts'' it may simply represent the underlying
       operating system's ability to run programs.
  </li>
</ol>

<p> There are three main approaches to server-side processing:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <strong>Computed Documents.</strong> Commonly called ``CGI scripts''
       after the Common Gateway Interface, these are actually <em>programs
       that compute documents.</em> They are usually run in response to a
       query or form submission, and are responsible both for performing any
       necessary actions, and outputting the response document to the browser.
       Java ``servlets'' also fall into this category -- servlets are small
       programs that are called from a specialized ``servlet engine'' server.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Embedded Actions.</strong> These are little ``code snippets''
       in some simple programming language embedded in otherwise-ordinary HTML
       documents.  Examples of this approach include Java Server Pages, Active
       Server Pages, PHP3, and MetaHTML.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Tag Definitions.</strong> These are XML tags, embedded in
       the active documents, with actions defined in some separate ``style
       sheet'' or template file.  The Cocoon system falls into this category;
       its stylesheets combine the XML-based XSLT stylesheet language with
       embedded Java code fragments for performing actions that XSLT cannot,
       such as arithmetic.
  </li>
</ol>

<p> The PIA is described in more detail in other white papers, specifically <a
    href="wp-webapp.html">Web Applications and the PIA</a> and <a
    href="wp-dps.html">Document Processing in the PIA</a>.  For now it is
    sufficient to explain that it combines aspects of <em>both</em> the
    embedded action <em>and</em> tag definition approaches.  It uses a
    complete programming language with XML syntax; this allows actions to be
    embedded in documents, but also allows the use of a separate tag
    definition file <em>in the same XML-based language.</em>
</p>

<h3>Moving a Web Application</h3>

<h4>The General Case</h4>

<p> Some of a web application's components are much easier to move between
    platforms than others:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Static documents:</strong>  these are inherently
       platform-independent.  Unfortunately, their <em>names</em> may not be. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Site structure:</strong> Filenames and other aspects of a
       site's structure can vary in several ways among platforms:
       <ol>
	 <li> <strong>File types:</strong> different platforms have different
	      ways of indicating the MIME type of a document.  For example,
	      Unix normally uses an extension of <code>.html</code> to
	      indicate a <code>text/html</code> document; Windows uses
	      <code>.htm</code>.  MacOS uses a file type stored in the file's
	      resource fork.
	 </li>
	 <li> <strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> Unix filenames are case
	      sensitive.  It is possible to distinguish, for example,
	      <code>Polish.html</code> and <code>polish.html</code>.  On other
	      operating systems one of these documents would have to be
	      renamed. 
	 </li>
	 <li> <strong>Name length:</strong> Most modern operating systems
	      permit long names for files, but many older systems do not.  DOS
	      is notorious for its ``8+3'' limitation; it also had a
	      limitation on <em>depth</em> (the length of a pathname) which
	      Windows 95 does its best to conceal from the user.
	 </li>
	 <li> <strong>Character set:</strong> Operating systems differ in the
	      set of characters permitted in filenames.  Letters, digits, and
	      hyphens are safe. 
	 </li>
       </ol>

       By planning ahead it is possible to avoid many of these problems.  As
       well as avoiding unusual characters and case sensitivity in filenames,
       it is usually possible to avoid exposing filename extensions to
       the client.  This can be done either by having the server select an
       appropriate extension based on content negotiation, or by using 
       directories as ``documents'' with the actual content in, e.g., the
       directory's <code>index.html</code> file.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Active documents:</strong> The most important documents in a
       web application (as opposed to a simple web site) are the active ones:
       the documents that do the work.  These include both CGI scripts and,
       more recently, documents with embedded code such as HHP3, ASP and JSP.
       When moving an application to a different platform, these active
       documents often have to be translated.  At least, some of the more
       common scripting languages and document formats are operating-system
       independent: a CGI script written in PERL or Python will usually be
       fairly portable.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Server features:</strong> Many, perhaps most, web servers have
       special features that an application may make use of.  Different
       servers may have different ways of keeping names and passwords for
       authentication, for example.  Some, such as Apache, may perform URL
       rewriting or invisible proxying.  Almost all modern servers have an API
       that allows efficient calls to code in some underlying programming
       language (C, Java, etc.).  These code modules are far more efficient
       than separate CGI scripts, but are also far less portable.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Operating environment:</strong> Some web applications interact
       strongly with their underlying operating systems and applications.
       Active documents running on a Microsoft platform can use COM to obtain
       services from standard applications; CGI scripts on Unix can use a
       command line for the same purpose. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Development environment:</strong> In some cases, changing the
       environment in which a web application is developed can be harder than
       changing the environment in which it operates.  If the development
       tools use a proprietary file format, a specialized database, or a
       nonstandard connection to the server, the application can be ``locked
       in'' and almost impossible to move. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Moving a PIA Application</h4>

<p> The structure of the PIA makes it particularly easy to move an application
    from one platform to another.  Because the only non-XML components of a
    typical PIA application are the processing engine and the low-level or
    ``primitive'' tag handlers, the worst case is that this small amount of
    code may have to be rewritten to fit into the new platform.
</p>

<p> The <em>usual</em> case is much better, because the PIA's document
    processor and tag handlers are already written in popular programming
    languages (Java and C) using standard interfaces (SAX and DOM), and so are
    already able to fit in to the most popular web application platforms.
    This means that porting a <em>typical</em> application may only involve
    rewriting a few custom tag handlers (perhaps with operating system
    dependencies) and possibly translating the application's configuration
    files. 
</p>

<p> Portability of document names and site structure are not a significant
    problem with ``pure'' PIA applications because the PIA's site
    configuration mechanism encourages the use of names without extensions,
    and allows arbitrary mapping of URL's onto files and directories.  This
    means that an application's files and directories can be renamed to fit
    the platform without changing the URL's exposed to the clients.  Moving
    a PIA application to a platform that doesn't include the PIA's site
    configuration package is fairly simple in platforms like Apache that
    include a URL rewriting mechanism.
</p>

<hr />
<h2>The PIA Web Application Framework</h2>

<h3>PIA-based Web Applications</h3>

<p> The PIA is primarily designed for web applications that are
    ``document-oriented'' -- both the ``content'' or data, and the processing
    instructions (including so-called ``business rules'' as well as
    stylesheets and ``macros'') are represented as XML documents.  The PIA is
    also server-based: all of its processing is done on the application's
    server.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> We note in passing that the fact that the PIA does its document
      processing on the server in no way prevents active documents, including
      Cascading Style Sheets, Javascript and Java applets, from being passed
      to a browser client where appropriate.  It <em>does</em> mean that
      ``stylesheet'' processing </em>can</em> be done entirely on the server,
      making an application accessible from <em>any</em> browser.
     [In particular, a tags might expand into either Javascript or
      HTML depending on the capabilities of the client, though I would not
      want to write such an application.]
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The point is worth emphasizing: a PIA web application consists
    <em>entirely</em> of XML and HTML documents, except for the
    document-processing ``engine'' that interprets the processing
    instructions.  Using server-side XML to build a web application has a
    number of advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> XML is a widely-accepted standard.  XML files are easily ported between
       platforms and shared among applications.
  </li>
  <li> Because processing takes place on the server side, all the browser
       needs to see is ordinary HTML (customized, if necessary, for the
       particular client).
  </li>
  <li> Because XML files are simply documents with a standardized format, the
       same file can be processed in several different ways.  This can be
       used to make a site index or a ``what's new'' list, or to improve
       interoperability with other sites (for example, many news sites
       maintain an XML file with the day's headlines, for the benefit of
       portal sites).
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>A Platform-Independent Web Application Framework</h3>

<p> The PIA's particular XML processing engine has a few additional
    advantages: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> It provides a complete set of processing operations, represented as XML
       ``tags,'' rather than providing a limited set (e.g. the
       tree-transformation operations of XSLT) or relying on ``escapes'' into
       another language (as do JSP, PHP, and others).  This means that PIA
       applications can be developed using any XML-aware development
       environment. 
  </li>
  <li> The mapping from tags to processing operations is completely defined by
       a document, called a ``tagset,'' that is completely separate from the
       document being processed.  Limiting the operations available when
       processing a document gives a simple but very effective form of
       security that can be especially useful in applications that allow users
       to upload or create documents.
  </li>
  <li> Unlike some other systems that are <em>purely</em> XML, the PIA is
       capable of processing ordinary HTML documents, optionally with a few
       XML tags embedded in them as extensions.  This makes it easier to
       incorporate ``legacy'' HTML documents into a primarily XML-based
       application.  HTML documents are also easier for users to create using
       simple text editors, which makes PIA-based applications easier to
       customize in a world that is not yet entirely ``XML-ready.''
  </li>
  <li> Because the processing engine itself is simple, and the set of
       basic processing operations is small, the PIA's document processing
       engine is easily ported to various server platforms.
  </li>
  <li> The reference implementation is written in Java, which is itself
       platform-neutral. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The PIA application platform also provides some additional functionality
    beyond the simple XML-based document-processing engine:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The PIA includes a web server engine (written in Java) that allows
       ``agents'' written in XML to operate on HTTP requests and responses.
       This can be useful when writing proxy-based applications.  The build-in
       server is also useful for testing web applications.
  </li>
  <li> The PIA also includes an extremely versatile scheme for defining the
       structure of a web site, using XML description files.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Running PIA applications on Other Platforms</h2>

<blockquote><em>
  A detailed discussion of the relationship between the PIA and other web
  technologies, including standards and protocols, can be found in
  <a href="wp-webapp.html#15">Web Applications and the PIA</a>.  In this
  section, we discuss making PIA style applications run on other
  platforms. 
</em></blockquote>

There are three ways of running PIA applications on other servers:
<ol>
<li>implement the primitive tags in an appropriately XML enabled server
<li>incorporate the PIA processing engine with the server
<li>automatically generate static pages with the appropriate inclusions
</ol>

[distinguish between the PIA tech and applications built in the PIA style,
order specific examples according to above list]


<p> Because of its implementation, the PIA's document-processing engine (and
    to a lesser extent its site-description mechanism) are particularly easy
    to incorporate into other web application platforms.  This makes it
    possible to build mixed systems that satisfy requirements (e.g. for
    performance or interoperability) that cannot easily be met by the PIA
    alone.  It also makes it easy to fit the PIA into existing systems, adding
    new capabilities without forcing a change of platform.
</p>

<h3>Java-based Systems</h3>

<p> Since the PIA's reference implementation is written in Java, and since it
    uses standard API's internally, it is easily incorporated into other
    Java-based application platforms.
</p>

<h4>Servlet engines</h4>

<p> The most common Java-based application platforms are web servers that use
    the Servlet (<code><a
    href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/servlet/2.2/javadoc/index.html"
    >javax.servlet</a></code> package) API.  Servlets provide a standard
    internal interface between a web server and Java code, and are a natural
    fit to the PIA. 
</p>

<p> The PIA provides two different Servlet implementations:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> A simple servlet that simply processes an input file using the PIA's
       document processing system.  This can be used to embed PIA processing
       in an existing static website or servlet-based application
  </li>
  <li> A more elaborate servlet that supports the PIA's site description
       mechanism as well.  This can be used to ``wrap'' an entire PIA-based
       application inside an existing servlet engine.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Cocoon</h4>

<p> <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</a> is a pure-XML engine
    based on XML-to-XML transformation engines called ``processors.''  The
    standard Processor in Cocoon is an implementation of the XML
    tree-transformation stylesheet language XSLT.  The PIA's document
    processor fits naturally into the Cocoon environment.
</p>


<h4>SAX- and DOM-based systems</h4>

<p> There are two main interfaces used in Java for manipulating XML and HTML
    files: 
</p>

<ol>
  <li> DOM (the Document Object Model) is a set of standardized interfaces by
       which an application can access a document's parse tree.  The PIA uses
       an extended implementation of the DOM as its internal representation,
       (as does Cocoon, in fact), making it particularly simple to interface
       to DOM-based applications. 
  </li>
  <li> SAX (Simple API for XML) is an ``event-driven'' interface, in which a
       simple parser (the ``driver'') calls a method on the application class
       for each ``event'' -- a block of text or the start or end of a tagged
       element.  The PIA's document processor can function as either a SAX
       driver <em>or</em> a SAX application (or both), so it can easily be
       ``spliced in'' to an existing SAX tool chain.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>C-based systems</h3>

<p> C is still by far the most widespread, most portable, and most completely
    standardized programming language currently in use.  It is particularly
    common to find a C compiler, and very little else, on the small or unusual
    processors used in embedded systems.  Also, many major pieces of software
    are written in C; in particular, the <a href="http://www.apache.org/"
    >Apache</a> web server.
</p>

<p> In order to better integrate with Apache, and in order to better serve the
    embedded system and network appliance markets, we have started an effort
    to re-implement the PIA's document processor in C.  In addition to
    improved interoperability, we expect this implementation to have
    <em>substantially</em> better performance than the Java version.
</p>

<p> Since Apache dominates the server market, with almost 60% of the installed
    base, we consider integration into Apache particularly important for the
    PIA.
</p>

<h3>Systems of Cooperating Servers</h3>

<p> Some servers, notably Apache, have the ability to invisibly route or proxy
    selected URL's to another server.  In fact, this ability is used inside
    Apache for its interfaces to Java and PERL.  It requires only a single
    line in Apache's configuration file, plus two parameters in the PIA's
    configuration file, to use the PIA in this mode.
</p>

<p> One advantage of using the PIA ``inside'' another server is that static
    pages can usually be served more efficiently by the other server.  Another
    is that a server such as Apache can provide services, such as virtual
    hosting and access to privileged ports, that are difficult for the PIA.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> One example is access to privileged ports, including port 80.  On Unix
      machines, only the ``superuser'' can access port 80, so a web server is
      expected to be started by the superuser and to change its user ID,
      typically to something safe like ``<code>nobody</code>,'' after opening
      its port.  Doing this in Java requires a non-portable native method.  It
      was far simpler to start the PIA under its own user ID and let Apache
      ``front'' for it.
  </p>
