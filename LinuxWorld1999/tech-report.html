<p> This technical report contains the slides that were presented in the
    session on the PIA at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, March
    4<sup>th</sup>, 1999.  The PIA has been released as open source software;
    the source code and documentation, as well as a copy of these slides, can
    be found on Ricoh's open source website, <code>www.RiSource.org</code>.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
  Information Appliances replace traditional software applications with web
  sites -- special-purpose ``thin'' servers.  Traditionally these are built
  on top of a free Unix such as Linux, which provides a stable, feature-rich
  platform and an excellent development environment.  Implementing an
  appliance, however, is still a matter of custom programming.
<p>
  Our Platform for Information Appliances is a framework which promises to
  make it significantly easier to build, maintain, and customize Web based
  applications.  The main component of this platform is a core engine for
  processing SGML (including XML and HTML) documents which makes it very
  easy to transform, compose, or otherwise modify documents.  It can also
  retrieve and operate on information from other web sites as well as local
  files.
<p>
  This engine makes it possible to create Web based applications that
  consist mainly (or solely) of a set of XML pages.  Upon request, the
  processor converts these pages into a desired format (e.g. HTML).  Unlike
  other scripting languages or active server pages, our source documents
  strictly adhere to the SGML standards and the semantics of the elements
  (tags) are fully under the control of the developer.  Actions associated
  with elements can be specified in XML or a traditional programming
  language.  This makes for a seamless interface between content,
  specification, and implementation.  The resulting application is very easy
  to maintain and build upon, with most customizations requiring little or
  no programming.
<p>
  In addition to the core processing engine, the platform includes templates
  for creating Web applications, the infrastructure needed for acting as a
  server, client, and processing proxy, and some other features (including
  sample applications and configuration files) that make it easy to bundle
  as a stand-alone information appliance.  The entire development
  environment, including its documentation, is organized as a web site; this
  makes it easy for a new user or developer to get up to speed.
<p>
  As an Open Source project, this platform should appeal to developers
  working on a range of Web based applications, from stand-alone 
  devices to personal proxy servers.  The document processing capabilities
  make it especially attractive for applications which must work in
  conjunction with other Web sites.  Example applications which have been
  built on this platform include a "digital photo album" for managing a
  collection of photographs taken with a digital camera, and a personal proxy
  server which maintains a browser-independent, permanent history database,
  and can be customized to remove certain types of (unsolicited) images from
  retrieved pages.
